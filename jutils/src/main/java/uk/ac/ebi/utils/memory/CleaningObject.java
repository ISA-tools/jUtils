/**
 * Simulates the old {@code finalize()} method in Java >= 9.
 * This is based on {@link MemoryUtils#registerCleaner(Object, Runnable) registering a new cleaner}
 * when an instance of this class (or subclasses) is created, such cleaner invokes {@link #close()}, 
 * which plays the same role of the old finalizer method.
 * 
 * This can be useful when you have a set of classes with an old finalize method, which you can 
 * subclass, after having renamed {@code finalize()} into {@code close()}.
