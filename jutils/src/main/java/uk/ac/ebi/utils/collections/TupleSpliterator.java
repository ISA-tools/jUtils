/**
 * <p>Takes an array of spliterators and returns a spliterator of tuples. Each tuple is built by taking the

 * The iteration stops as son as there is at least one spliterator which of {@link Spliterator#tryAdvance(Consumer)} 
 * method returns false.</p>
 * 
 * Parallelism support is limited: {@link #trySplit()} succeeds as long as all the underlining spliterators are able
 * to return prefixes having all the same size (tails of different size have chances to be managed by the behaviour of
 * {@link #tryAdvance(Consumer)}, by cutting results at the shortest one).

 * Another restriction is that all base spliterators must be {@link Spliterator#IMMUTABLE} and 
 * non-{@link Spliterator#CONCURRENT}.

	 *     a, b, c, d       => a, b, c | d
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * trySplit() over the second tuple spliterator will return a tuple iterator yielding 3 elements (1a, 2b, 3c) and
