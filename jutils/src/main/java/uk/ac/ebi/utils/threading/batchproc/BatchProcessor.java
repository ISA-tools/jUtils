/**  
 * ## Batch Processor Skeleton 
 * 
 * A simple skeleton to manage processing of data in multi-thread mode.  
 * 
 * The idea for which this class and {@link BatchCollector batch collectors} provide scaffolding for
 * is that a data source is used to build `B` batches and, when 
 * {@link BatchCollector#batchReadyFlag() a batch is ready to be processed}, it is submitted to a `BJ`
 * job and run in parallel by an {@link #getExecutor()}.   
 * 
 * This class is just a skeleton, for a concrete implementation you need to realise the above source
 * processing loop on your own. In order to facilitate that, {@link #handleNewBatch(Object, boolean)}
 * is provided. You should call it periodically, and it checks if the current batch (that you're filling)
 * is ready for submission and, if yes, it submits the current batch to a new parallel job, 
 * {@link BatchCollector#batchFactory() creates a new batch} and returns it (normally it returns the current
 * batch).  
 * 
 * At the end of such a loop, you should call {@link #waitExecutor(String)}, so that the final batch you were building
 * is forced into processing and other close-up operations are performed.  
 * 
 * As you can see above, {@link BatchCollector} is another facility to manage batch creation and decide if a
 * batch is ready to be processed.   
 * 
 * Specific implementations are provided for both {@link BatchCollector} and this processor class.
 * For instance, We have an {@link ItemizedBatchProcessor item-based processor}, which 
 * {@link ItemizedBatchProcessor#process(Consumer, Object...) implements} the above-described source dispatching loop
 * as the fetch from a stream of items, which are sent to batches.  
 * 
 * This specific processor uses {@link ItemizedSizedBatchCollector item-based collectors}, which of default implementation
 * decides if a batch is ready to go on the basis of the {@link ItemizedSizedBatchCollector#batchSizer() number of items}
 * it has. Other specific processors are those {@link CollectionBasedBatchProcessor based on Java collections}, which 
 * makes use of corresponding {@link CollectionBatchCollector}.  
 * 
 * Note that, while we consider sychronisation issues for the {@link #getBatchJob() batch processing jobs}, we assume that
 * the initiation and submission operations are run by a single thread (eg, `main`), so the code about that isn't 
 * thread-safe. For instance, {@link #waitExecutor(String)} won't synchronise over the {@link #getExecutor() current executor}
 * and {@link #setBatchJob(Consumer)} won't synchronise over the current job. Instantiating multiple processors is a 
 * safe way to deal with such a multi-multi-thread scenario. Likely, you'll want to share the executor job in such a case.
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * @param <B> the type of batch to be handled
 * @param <BC> the type of {@link BatchCollector} to use for batch operations
 * @param <BJ> the type of job that is able to process a batch of type `B`
